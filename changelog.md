- more precise heuristic for slightly less mismatched heads, especially on server messages

- fix missing heads for certain server plugins using "disguised" messages.  
  Thanks Suiranoil for bringing this up!

- option to disable handling of system messages, thanks again to Suiranoil!  
  This allows for even less mismatched heads, but will break heads completely on servers that turn player messages into system messages.  
  You've been warned!
